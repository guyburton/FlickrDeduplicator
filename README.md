# FlickrDeduplicator
Yet another deduplicator for Flickr- this works off image hashes rather than title/date. It takes a while to run since it has to hash all of your images. If you stop the program mid way through indexing, it should resume cleanly. 

This is strictly for personal use- feel free to use/improve as you wish but I take no responsibility for it's operation, data loss etc. 

To get this working you will need to create a config.ini file with a new pair of API key/secret and an auth.txt with your personal account credentials.
